#Knownabouts

Language developed largely based on sarcasm and used by a group of teenage friends growing up in Leytonstone, London, UK aroung 1990. Some expansion into workplaces and universities. To anyone reading it will likely come across as a private joke. I do not believe this to be a unique phenomena and consider most social groups to have at least have a few words that are privately known to describe common experiences.
